# Getting started with SHIF Front-End

This project was created using the React Leafy Library with TS.

Below are the steps to run the project locally

1. ### `npm install --force`

Install all the dependencies, without --force is probably not gonna work depending on your node and react version. Using force option you just disable the warnings

2. ### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Other Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run serve`

This will build the project and start a static file server locally to test the application build locally prior to deploying to App Services.

**Note: You'll need to have the `serve` package installed globally**

`npm i -g serve`
